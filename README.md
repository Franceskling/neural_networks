# neural_networks



I chose to use three layers in my neural network in order to optimize the model training. Layer 1 contained 12 neurons, layer 2 contained 10 neurons, and layer 3 contained 8 neurons. I did not achieve the target model performance of 75%, I achieved 53.3%. I increased the layers and adjusted the neurons in each layer to increase the accuracy. Unfortunately, adjusting the layers and neurons only allowed the accuracy to fluctuate between approximately 49% and 53%. I also tried to increase the epochs; however, anything over 50 had no change in the result. Since I used the sigmoid activation function for the output layer, I could have used the logisitic regression model to get a result very similar (53.4% rather than 53.3%) and much faster.
